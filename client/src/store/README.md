# State Management

This folder contains the application's global state management logic. It typically includes store configuration, reducers, middleware, and any utilities related to managing state across the app.

## Guidelines

- **Centralization:** Keep all global state logic here to ensure a single source of truth.
- **Modularity:** Organize reducers, actions, and middleware into separate files or sub-folders for maintainability.
- **Scalability:** Use feature-based slices or modules to keep the store scalable as the application grows.
- **Testing:** Include unit tests for reducers, actions, and selectors.

## Typical Contents

- **Store Configuration:** Main file for setting up the Redux store or other state management library.
- **Reducers/Slices:** Logic for updating state based on dispatched actions.
- **Actions:** Action creators for dispatching changes to the store.
- **Middleware:** Custom middleware for handling side effects (e.g., logging, async operations).
- **Selectors:** Functions for selecting and deriving data from the state.

## Usage

Import the store into your application entry point and provide it to your app using a provider (e.g., `<Provider store={store}>` for Redux). Use hooks to connect functions to access and update global state within your components.

## Example Structure
```

|------ rootReducer.js      # Combines all reducers
|------ userSlice.js        # Example feature slice
|------ middleware.js       # Custom middleware
|------ selectors.js        # Common selectors
