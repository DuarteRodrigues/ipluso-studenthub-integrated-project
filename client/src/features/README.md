# Features

This folder contains feature-specific modules, including UI components, logic, and state management related to individual features of the application.

## Guidelines

- **Encapsulation:** Keep all files related to a feature (components, hooks, slices, API calls, styles) within its own folder.
- **Separation:** Avoid mixing unrelated features in the same folder.
- **Reusability:** If a component or utility is used by multiple features, consider placing it in the `components` or `utils` folder instead.
- **Testing:** Include unit and integration tests for feature logic and UI.

## Typical contents

- **UI Components:** Feature-specific React components.
- **State Management:** Redux slices, context, or hooks for managing feature state.
- **API Logic:** Functions or services for interacting with backend endpoints.
- **Styles:** CSS or style files specific to the feature.

## Structure

Each subfolder within `features/` should represent a distinct feature or functionality. This helps keep related code organized and maintainable.

## Example Structure

```
src/
|
|-- features/
|------ chat/
|---------- Chat.jsx
|---------- chatSlice.js
|---------- chatAPI.js
|
|------ profile/
|---------- Profile.jsx
|---------- profileSlice.js
|---------- profileAPI.js
|
|------ notifications/
|---------- Notifications.jsx
|---------- notificationsSlice.js
|---------- notificationsAPI.js
```

Keep this folder organized by feature to improve maintainability and collaboration.
